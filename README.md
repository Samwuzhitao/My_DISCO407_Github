# X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1 
### Introduction
The X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1 is an evaluation board based on digital MEMS microphones. It is compatible with the Morpho connector layout, and it's designed around STMicroelectronics MP34DT01-M digital microphones. It has two microphones soldered on board and it is compatible with digital microphone coupon boards such as STEVAL-MKI129Vx and STEVAL-MKI155Vx. The X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1 allows the acquisition and streaming of up to 2 microphones using the I²S peripheral and up 4 coupon microphones using both I²S and SPI. It represents an easy to use and fast solution for the development of microphone based application as well as a starting point for audio algorithm implementation.
 
### Key Features
